Hi folks, 

I have over 6 years of industry experience as a Machine Learning Engineer and Tech Lead, working on cutting-edge and impactful problems in large language models, multimodal machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing. Currently, I am a Machine Learning TL at LinkedIn, where I build large personalized machine learning models for the Feed AI team, applying my expertise in generative AI, online and offline ML, representation learning, and NLP techniques.

In my previous roles at Facebook and Apple, I contributed to cross-platform ML on Instagram and other family of apps, and multimodal and NLP R&D for Siri Natural Language, respectively. I also demonstrated and presented my work at various internal and external events, such as the Apple ML Summit, the Natural Language Understanding workshop, and the ICASSP conference. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology, where I studied machine learning and interactive intelligent systems, and worked on computer vision and optimization problems in the Robotics Lab. I have published patents and papers at ICASSP, International Journal of Computer Applications, and obtained multiple certifications from Coursera and NVIDIA. I am also a Tata Scholar, a K C Mahindra Scholar, and a Stanford Summer School attendee. 

I am passionate about solving challenging and impactful problems using machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I am always eager to learn new techniques and tools to enhance my expertise and performance. I enjoy working with talented and diverse teams, and I value collaboration, innovation, and excellence. If your interests align with mine, I would love to talk to you, please reach out to me at akanksha.bindal@gmail.com.

When i'm not building models, you'll find me enjoying sci-fi movies / books, being a fitness junkie or on a coffee run. 

<!-- I consider myself a lifelong learner and believe in working hard. I graduated from UC San Diego with a Master's in Computer Science with a Machine Learning specialization in June 2018. I'm currently working at Twitter in the Timelines Quality team, building relevance and machine learning systems. Previously, I worked at Amazon with Amazon Expansions and Exports Tech team. <br> <br> -->

<!-- My interests are in the Applied ML, Recommender Systems, and NLP domains. I got my first exposure to Machine Learning during my internships at IIT Madras, India, developing scalable Bayesian models for the movie rating prediction tasks. <br> <br> -->

<!-- At UC San Diego, I worked on several research projects under the guidance of Prof. Julian McAuley. Recently, one of our research papers got accepted at <a href="http://acl2019.org/EN/index.xhtml" target="_blank">ACL 2019</a>. We proposed a neural network architecture to detect spoilers in review datasets and contributed an <a href="https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/reviews" target="_blank">extensive book review dataset</a> for spoiler detection. We published another work at RecSys 2018 last year. We proposed a new machine learning framework for predicting the fit of clothing products to recommend appropriate product sizes to customers. The proposed approach improves upon a method proposed by Amazon by up to 18%. In this work, we released two <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/clothing-fit-dataset-for-size-recommendation" target="_blank">novel datasets</a>, collected specifically for the task of clothing size recommendation. <br> <br> -->

<!-- Apart from this, I interned at Amazon in Summer 2017. My project was to support primary key constraints, batch inserts/updates, transactions, and compaction in Hive while ensuring read consistency. This project was particularly challenging as the Hive is not designed to handle transactional data and operations. I also worked with Arcesium, a recently formed subsidiary of D.E. Shaw & Co, as a Software Developer. I was responsible for revamping the infrastructure while ensuring scalability and robustness. <br> <br> -->

<!-- My industry experience helps me understand the intricacies involved in developing critical and time-intensive software. In contrast, my research experience is providing me an in-depth knowledge of the Machine Learning field. These learnings drive all of my work. <br> <br> -->
